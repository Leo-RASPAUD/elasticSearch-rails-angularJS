**Simple rails + angularJS application done an interview**<br/>
The goal was to have an angularJS frotend (ES6 syntax + babel) and a simple rail backend posting request to an elastic cluster.<br/>
**As the code is public on this repo, I have removed the connection informations so it's impossible to execute the code.**<br/>

- Backend
> Go to backend folder
> Launch rails with "rails s"

- Frontend
> Go to frontend folder
> Launch webpack with "yarn run develop"

- Unit tests
> Backend : rails -s
> Frontend : yarn run test:unit
