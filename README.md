#Instructions
**Simple rails + angularJS application done an interview**
The goal was to have an angularJS frotend (ES6 syntax + babel) and a simple rail backend posting request to an elastic cluster.

**As the code is public on this repo, I have removed the connection informations so it's impossible to execute the code.**

## Backend
* Go to backend folder
* Launch rails with "rails s"

## Frontend
* Go to frontend folder
* Launch webpack with "yarn run develop"

## Unit tests
* Backend : rails -s
* Frontend : yarn run test:unit
